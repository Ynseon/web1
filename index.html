  <h2>WEB</h2>
  The World Wide Web is a place where people connected to the Internet can
  share information with each other. It's also called WWW or W3 for short,
  and is most commonly called Web. It's used the same way as the Internet,
  but to be exact, the web is just one popular service on the Internet.
Today, however, the words "internet" and "web" are used interchangeably,
making up the largest part of the Internet.
